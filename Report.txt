**Title:** Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning  

**Author:** Grace  

**Objective:**  
The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on housing attributes.  

**Dataset:**  
- Source: `Housing_data.csv`  
- Contains features like size, rooms, year built, location, and the target variable `price`.  

**Methodology:**  
1. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and correlations.  
2. Preprocessed data (missing value handling, encoding categorical variables, scaling).  
3. Split data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.  
4. Trained a **Linear Regression** model.  
5. Evaluated performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**.  
6. Visualized predicted vs actual house prices.  

**Findings:**  
- The model achieved a reasonable R² score, showing it explains a good portion of house price variation.  
- Features with the strongest influence:  
  - **Square footage** (larger homes → higher price).  
  - **Location** (certain neighborhoods add/subtract significant value).  
  - **Number of rooms** (positive impact but diminishing after a point).  
  - **Year built** (newer houses typically more expensive).  
- The model tends to **underestimate very expensive houses**, which is common for Linear Regression.  

**Conclusion:**  
Machine learning can effectively estimate house prices. With advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost), predictions can be improved further. This project demonstrates the **value of data-driven insights** in the real estate market.
